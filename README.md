# 12_Collatz_Sequence_Python
Collatz Sequence. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”.

The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1 problem, is the simplest impossible math problem. 
From a starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next number in the sequence: 
1. If n is even, the next number n is n / 2. 
2. If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1. 
3. If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat. It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that every starting number eventually terminates at 1.
